## Platforms
I will post recipes in this repository for installing Qiskit on various platforms as I revisit those platforms.
Currently we have
* s390 (This was blogged as [Using Qiskit on IBM z Systems](https://medium.com/qiskit/using-qiskit-on-ibm-z-systems-398c0c68ffad))
	* a recipe for LinuxOne Ubuntu 20.04 as provisioned by the [Linuxone Community Cloud](https://linuxone.cloud.marist.edu/#/login).
	* a recipe for LinuxOne RedHat 8.4 as provisioned by the [Linuxone Community Cloud](https://linuxone.cloud.marist.edu/#/login).
	* a dockerfile for a Qiskit container in RHEL8 (contributed, not tested by me)

No guarantees, of course! Such recipes tend to quickly go out of date. [Post an issue](https://github.com/jwoehr/Quantum-Computing/issues) if you find any problems, please!
